# Film Explorer
- A website that:
    - Allows you to browse through movies/shows using TMDB API
    - Can give you a random movie/show
    - Recommends you movies (W.I.P)

## Finished Work
- So far, I have been able to implement a browsing system which allows users to go through shows and movies. Users are able to create, log in, and log out of accounts and have the website remember them with the help of Flask-SQLalchemy for database management and Flask session for cookie management.

## Unfinished Work
- What's unfinished? Too many features to count. I haven't added a system that recommends you movies (which is supposed to be the key feature), the feature that allows you to like movies/shows (or dislike them), the option to browse through other users accounts, etc.
